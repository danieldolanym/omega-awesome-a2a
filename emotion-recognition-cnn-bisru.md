# Emotion Recognition with CNN-BiSRU

## Overview
A novel multimodal emotion recognition architecture combining CNN and BiSRU with attention mechanisms. Achieves improved accuracy through feature fusion of local and temporal emotional patterns.

## Technical Details
- Two-channel architecture: CNN for local features + BiSRU for temporal processing
- Attention mechanism for feature emphasis
- GloVe word vectorization
- Maximum pooling converter in BiSRU channel

## Implementation
```python
# Core model architecture
class EmotionRecognitionModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, vocab_size, embedding_dim, num_classes):
        super(EmotionRecognitionModel, self).__init__()
        self.embedding = nn.Embedding(vocab_size, embedding_dim)
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv1d(embedding_dim, 128, kernel_size=3)
        self.bisru = nn.GRU(embedding_dim, 64, bidirectional=True)
        self.attention = nn.MultiheadAttention(128, num_heads=8)

Key Features
Two-channel architecture combining CNN and BiSRU
GloVe word vectorization for input processing
Attention mechanism for important feature emphasis
Maximum pooling converter in BiSRU channel
Feature fusion for comprehensive emotion analysis
Importance for A2A Applications
This architecture is significant for A2A applications as it demonstrates how to effectively combine local feature extraction (CNN) with temporal sequence processing (BiSRU) for emotion recognition. The attention mechanism and feature fusion approach provide a template for building more sophisticated multimodal systems that can process both spatial and temporal aspects of input data.

Usage Example
# Model initialization
model = EmotionRecognitionModel(
    vocab_size=10000,
    embedding_dim=300,
    num_classes=6  # Basic emotions
)

# Sample usage
batch_size = 32
sequence_length = 100
sample_input = torch.randint(0, 10000, (batch_size, sequence_length))
predictions = model(sample_input)
