# CogVLM: Deep Fusion Visual Language Model

## Overview
CogVLM introduces a revolutionary approach to vision-language modeling by implementing a trainable visual expert module directly in attention and FFN layers, enabling deep fusion between vision and language without compromising NLP capabilities. This architecture represents a significant departure from traditional shallow alignment methods.

## Technical Implementation
```python
# Example implementation using CogVLM
from cogvlm import CogVLMModel

model = CogVLMModel.from_pretrained("THUDM/cogvlm-17b")

# Process image and text
def process_multimodal_input(image_path, text_query):
    image = load_image(image_path)
    response = model.generate(
        image=image,
        text=text_query,
        max_length=100
    )
    return response

# Visual reasoning example
result = process_multimodal_input(
    "example.jpg",
    "What are the main objects in this image?"
)
